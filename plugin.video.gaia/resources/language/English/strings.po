msgid "This feature will configure the connection timeout of Kodiâ€™s player in number of seconds. It can take some time to establish a connection to a file on a server. This especially applies to hoster links resolved through a debrid service. Debrid services might have to convert, process, or move files around before allowing them to be streamed. Kodi has a default timeout of 30 seconds, which might not be enough for some of these slower connections. Kodi will terminate the connection in such a case and streaming the file will not be possible. Waiting a little bit longer than the default timeout might allow you to stream these slow files.[CR][CR]Note that this is not a Gaia setting, but rather an advanced Kodi setting specified in the [I]advancedsettings.xml[/I] file. This means that the cURL timeout will apply to Kodi globally, including all other addons.

This means that the video buffer will apply to Kodi globally, including all other addons.[CR][CR]Kodi requires your device to have free memory that is at least 3 times the size of the buffer.
