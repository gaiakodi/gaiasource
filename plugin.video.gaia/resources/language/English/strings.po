msgid "This feature will configure the connection timeout of Kodiâ€™s player in number of seconds. It can take some time to establish a connection to a file on a server. This especially applies to hoster links resolved through a debrid service. Debrid services might have to convert, process, or move files around before allowing them to be streamed. Kodi has a default timeout of 30 seconds, which might not be enough for some of these slower connections. Kodi will terminate the connection in such a case and streaming the file will not be possible. Waiting a little bit longer than the default timeout might allow you to stream these slow files.[CR][CR]Note that this is not a Gaia setting, but rather an advanced Kodi setting specified in the [I]advancedsettings.xml[/I]  file. This means that the cURL timeout will apply to Kodi globally, including all other addons. More info can be found at:[CR][CR]     [I]https://kodi.wiki/view/Advancedsettings.xml#network[/I][CR][CR][B]Kodi has to be restarted for this setting to take effect.[/B]"

This feature will not help if you experience constant buffering due to a slow internet or because the server you are streaming from has a slow connection.[CR][CR]Note that this is not a Gaia setting, but rather an advanced Kodi setting specified in the [I]advancedsettings.xml[/I]  file. This means that the video buffer will apply to Kodi globally, including all other addons.[CR][CR]Kodi requires your device to have free memory that is at least 3 times the size of the buffer. Kodi has a 20 MB buffer by default and therefore needs 60 MB of memory. If your buffer is too large, Kodi might run out of memory and crash. Try to keep the buffer in bounds and not exceed 50% of free memory.
